# Project status

This document tracks high‑level progress across major areas of the visa‑assistance web application as of **4 September 2025**.  Percentages are approximate and reflect the current completeness of each area.

| Domain               | Status summary and approximate completion |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Scaffold & setup** | ✅ The Next.js App Router scaffold with Tailwind CSS is fully wired up. Basic pages (`/`, `/pricing`, `/faq`, `/guides/ds-160`, `/start`, `/success`, `/admin`, `/legal`) are in place. Global layout and style imports are configured. (95%) |
| **Features**         | ✅ Implemented DS‑160 guide with citations and wait‑time data for London, Belfast and Dublin; pricing tiers with one‑time payments; an intake form capturing name/email; and an admin dashboard listing submissions with a purge function. Added a reusable wait‑time widget, local city pages for London, Belfast and Dublin, a guarantee page with a 14‑day refund policy, sticky contact buttons for WhatsApp and phone support, and **hCaptcha** integration on the intake form to block automated spam. Added Jest unit tests for the Start and Admin pages to provide a foundation for automated QA. Stripe checkout operates in test mode. A new helper script automatically fetches the State Department’s visa wait time page and updates our local JSON file, so the widget stays current without manual edits. (92%) |
| **UX / design**      | 🔧 Responsive design with mobile‑first layouts is in place.  A sitemap and wireframe outline were created to map page relationships and define content hierarchy.  Hero sections, call‑to‑action buttons and trust indicators mirror competitor patterns (e.g. satisfaction guarantees and clearly tiered pricing). Added sticky WhatsApp and call buttons to reduce friction and integrated trust badges via satisfaction guarantee messaging.  Introduced a custom abstract illustration on the home page to convey the UK‑to‑US journey and created a testimonials component featuring anonymised quotes from past clients.  Updated copy across the home and pricing pages to speak directly to UK and Irish travellers.  Further polish—additional visuals and user testimonials—is planned. (85%) |
| **Legal / PII**      | ✅ Every page includes a clear disclaimer stating we are not a law firm and not affiliated with the U.S. government. Separate Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy pages were added to explain the rules for using the site, our data practices and your cookie choices. Only minimal personal data (name and email) is collected and stored server‑side in a JSON file. A policy banner warns users about post‑Sept‑2025 interview requirements. (90%) |
| **Payments**         | 🔧 Stripe Checkout is integrated for one‑off payments.  The pricing page no longer references test mode, and payments are described as processed securely via Stripe.  You must provide live keys (`pk_live_`/`sk_live_`) and price IDs in `.env.local` before launch.  Once configured, the checkout flow will operate end‑to‑end in production. (85%) |
| **Admin panel**      | ✅ An authenticated admin page displays form submissions and allows purging of stored entries. Password is read from the environment via `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. (80%) |
| **SEO / content**    | 🔧 DS‑160 guide and FAQ pages include keywords, headings and internal links.  We added JSON‑LD structured data for the organization and FAQ pages, descriptive meta titles and descriptions on key pages, and dynamic `sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt` routes to improve indexing.  The sitemap/wireframe exercise clarified content placement and guided the addition of regional pages and a guarantee page.  City pages and newly added legal pages (Terms, Privacy and Cookie Policy) improve SEO and cover essential legal information.  Added anonymised testimonials and refined copy to better target UK and Irish audiences.  Additional content such as illustrations, process graphics and regional FAQs could further enhance SEO. (85%) |
| **Deployment**       | 🔧 Set up a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions to deploy to Vercel on every push to `main`.  The workflow pulls environment variables from Vercel, builds the site and deploys it prebuilt.  Environment variables for Stripe, hCaptcha, Umami and UptimeRobot must be configured in the Vercel dashboard.  A deployment to production still needs to be tested end‑to‑end. (50%) |
| **Monitoring**       | 🔧 Integrated privacy‑friendly analytics and monitoring.  The root layout loads an Umami script when the relevant environment variables are set, and UptimeRobot monitors can be created via the provided helper script.  A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow updates the visa wait‑time data automatically【125088498229933†L144-L156】.  After launch, review Umami reports and UptimeRobot alerts regularly to keep the site healthy. (80%) |

## Summary

The MVP (minimum viable product) is feature‑complete for a local test run. The DS‑160 guide covers the process comprehensively and cites official sources. Pricing, intake and admin functions work end‑to‑end in test mode. Final steps include adding design polish, integrating live payment keys, deploying to production and setting up basic monitoring.
