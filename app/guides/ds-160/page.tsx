      <h1>DS‑160 Guide</h1>
      <p>
        The DS‑160, officially known as the “Online Non‑immigrant Visa
        Application,” is the first step for anyone seeking a temporary U.S.
        visa. Each applicant, regardless of age or visa category, must complete
        their own DS‑160 form online【582395398831132†L112-L124】. The form collects personal
        information, travel history and security‑related background and is used by
        consular officers to assess eligibility for a visa【582395398831132†L96-L103】.
      </p>

      <h2>Where to file</h2>
      <p>
        You must complete the DS‑160 on the Consular Electronic Application
        Center (CEAC) website at{' '}
        <a href="https://ceac.state.gov" className="underline">ceac.state.gov</a>. You can save
        your progress and return later, but inactive sessions time out after
        about 20 minutes, so save frequently【582395398831132†L318-L323】. Before starting, gather
        your passport, travel itinerary, employment details and a compliant
        digital photograph. Each applicant needs their own DS‑160—even
        children, although a parent or guardian can complete it on their behalf
       【582395398831132†L114-L119】.
      </p>

      <h2>Completing the form</h2>
      <p>
        Work through each section carefully. The DS‑160 requests identifying
        information (name, date of birth, passport details), address history,
        travel plans, social media handles, previous U.S. visits and a series of
        security questions. Answer truthfully—submitting false information can
        result in refusal and potential findings of misrepresentation under
        immigration law【582395398831132†L252-L256】. You must also upload a passport‑style
        photo meeting strict U.S. visa requirements. The system may reject
        incorrect file formats or sizes; if the upload fails, you will need to
        bring a printed photo to your interview【582395398831132†L208-L223】.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common mistakes include misspelling names, entering incorrect
        passport numbers, failing to list prior U.S. travel or visa refusals,
        leaving required fields blank or using “N/A” incorrectly, and uploading
        non‑compliant photos【582395398831132†L211-L223】. Take your time and cross‑check your
        answers against supporting documents such as your passport, job
        letters and itineraries.
      </p>

      <h2>Submitting and saving your confirmation</h2>
      <p>
        Before you click “Submit,” review every section carefully. Once the
        DS‑160 has been submitted it cannot be reopened or edited. If you spot
        an error afterward, you must complete a new DS‑160 and bring both
        confirmation pages to your interview【582395398831132†L243-L276】. When you submit, you
        electronically sign the form and confirm that all answers are true and
        accurate【582395398831132†L251-L256】.
      </p>
      <p>
        After submission, the system generates a confirmation page with a
        barcode and unique confirmation number【582395398831132†L260-L264】. Print this page and
        keep a digital copy. You will need the confirmation number to schedule
        your visa interview and must bring the printed page to your appointment
       【582395398831132†L260-L267】.
      </p>

      <h2>Linking your DS‑160 to an interview</h2>
      <p>
        With your confirmation number in hand, pay the visa application fee
        (MRV fee) and create an account on the U.S. Visa Appointment Service
        website. This site, operated by the Department of State’s contractor,
        allows you to pay your MRV fee, add your DS‑160 confirmation number and
        schedule an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate that serves your
        region【773686817609439†L288-L324】. Applicants in England and Wales typically attend
        interviews in London; those in Northern Ireland may use the Belfast
        Consulate, and applicants in Ireland can select Dublin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Appointment availability depends on visa category and local demand.  For
        applicants based in England or Wales who interview in London, the U.S.
        Embassy reports approximate wait times of around 3 days for students and
        exchange visitors (F, M, J), about 7 days for petition‑based workers
        (H, L, O, P, Q) and roughly 82 days for visitor visas (B1/B2)【773686817609439†L269-L276】.  A
        global snapshot of wait times published in early 2025 listed London at
        roughly 90 days for visitor visas, 10 days for student visas and 20 days
        for work visas【399386585920852†L133-L170】.  Applicants in Northern Ireland who
        attend the U.S. Consulate in Belfast face shorter queues—about 14 days
        for student or exchange visitors, 14 days for petition‑based workers,
        14 days for crew/transit and approximately 82 days for visitor visas
        (B1/B2)【348764542151161†L182-L186】.  Meanwhile, Ireland’s embassy in Dublin reports
        around 4 days for students, 4 days for petition‑based categories, 4 days
        for crew/transit and as little as 3 days for visitor visas【348764542151161†L390-L394】.
        Because these estimates fluctuate weekly and do not guarantee
        availability, schedule your appointment well in advance and monitor the
        official portal for earlier openings【773686817609439†L250-L284】.
      </p>

      <h2>Fees & timelines</h2>
      <p>
        The MRV fee varies by visa category. Non‑petition‑based visas—such as
        visitor (B1/B2) and student (F/M)—cost $185. Petition‑based categories
        like H, L, O, P, Q and R cost $205. Treaty trader/investor visas (E
        category) cost $315【339123271819074†L762-L766】. These fees are non‑refundable and must
        be paid before you can schedule your interview. After your interview,
        if your visa is approved, processing typically takes 3–5 working days
        plus another 2–3 days for delivery of your passport【773686817609439†L284-L286】. In some
        cases, additional administrative processing (“221(g)”) may extend the
        timeline【534810399991317†L189-L204】【399386585920852†L256-L263】.
